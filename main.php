                <h2>EXPERIENCE HISTORY</h2>
                <div style="color: #581845"> Welcome to The Antiques, where history comes to life through a curated collection of rare and captivating artifacts. Each piece and décor have their own adventures and stories. Some have been crafted with great purpose, while others are keepsakes and a reminder of the love and dedication upheld by their craftsmen. 
                <br><br>
                Their journeys serve not only as a window to the past, but as great wisdom and a source of empowerment for us at the present days. Our home hopes to welcome and immerse you into their worlds—to experience the lost years and relive the days of the bygone past. 
                <br><br>
                The artifacts and objects can be viewed at our physical location, but if you’d like to know more, then our website aims to inform you about some of the various pieces and the brief history of our own organization. </div>

              <div style="color: #581845"> Other than our front page, you may also peruse through our Antique Furniture, Vintage Decors, Collectibles and Curiosities pages to find some of the artifacts we’ve collected throughout our history. 
              <br><br>
              Our Antique Furniture and Vintage Decors pages specifically have items such as chairs or various architecture. The Collectibles and Curiosities pages are, however, smaller objects with valuable history or peculiarities that we still don’t know! 
              <br><br>
              They each have a photo and brief description regarding their physical details and background. You can also visit our Developer page, where you can see the various people who helped make this project come true.</div>

                <h2>GAZE AND WONDER</h2>
                <div style="color: #581845"> We have three main goals with our project: to make our history known to the people, to allow people the opportunity to appreciate history, and to fund our escapades and allow us to gather more artifacts. 
                <br><br>
                By creating this website for people around the world to see, we hope to reach more people in our journey and hopefully get our own opportunities to share our passion with the world. After all, websites are more accessible compared to traditional means of sharing information such as newspapers or by word. 
                <br><br>
                A website also allows us to consolidate the various data we’ve collected and organize them with ease. Finally, most things on the internet often last forever, and through this website, we can find a little space, just for us, tucked away in the confines of the wide web, to be refurnished for the future, and for our own history, as well!
